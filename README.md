Utilizing javascript and jquery I have created buttons that will ping the Giphy API and show 10 random giphys of the anime that is titled on the chosen button. You can also add more options to choose from in the input field at the top right of the screen. I've also attempted to allow for a download button, and a favorites button to appear so that the user can hold on to their favorite giphs.
